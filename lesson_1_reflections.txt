How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It really make to see a difference a lot easier,
    like found exact lines that differs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It can let me reuse my old code again, even if I already change it by another code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros is logical argumented. Cons is sometimes you forget to save your version and could lose your work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in some VCS like Git, there are logical reasons to change more than one file during making one logical change of function.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - to view history of commits
    fit diff - to view difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It always has history version, so I can easily get to functional version and find the bug wti git diff.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Actually nothing, happy to have that working
